# The Great Plan

This file serves as my todo-list, scratchpad and planpad for the project.

## Name

The name is about to change. Great ideas by ChatGPT:

- Devs of Destiny: The Quest for IT Stardom
- The Quest for Technomancy: Mastering the Developer Realm
- Heroes of the Devverse: Forge Your Career Path
- Jobseeker's Odyssey: Rise to IT Immortality.

## Menu

- Main menu
- Choose difficulty, start game, credits, options

## Difficulties

The game will have different difficulties:

- hard = start as a fresh graduate, no experience
- medium = junior, rather easy to get new job
- easy = already a senior with job, get offer almost instantly, game ends in under a minute

## Game ending

Game ends when the player gets a job. The points are calculated with some pattern like (days _ salary _ job \* difficulty).

# UI

Instead of clock hh:mm:ss, show day number and "morning, noon, .."
Stats: stress, hunger .. . Change these when time passes.

## Buttons

Make the phone button flash when there is a call incoming.

# Logic

### MAIL

- Job offers
- Job rejections
- IT courses
- Junk mail

### PHONE

- Implement call and answering
- Scammers
- Invitations to job interviews
- Phone interviews
- Friend calls

### JOB LISTING

- list of jobs from .csv file

### CV

- data from .csv file

### FRIDGE

- shows the inside of the fridge
- eat/drink, lowers hunger

### TRAIN

- Opportunity to create a project, learn new language, participate in a coding challenge, do a bootcamp

### Go out

- shop
- interview
- take a walk
- visit a friend

## Interviews

- randomly generated questions
- the harder the job, the harder the interview
- intelligence tests
- writing tests

## LinkedIn?

- some kind of linkedin copy

## Job offer

- Accept/decline
- Negotiate salary

# TODO

- instead of having a textArea as gameScreen, implement different views for every button.
- implement also an interview view
- how to do?

1. make gamescreen pane/something
2. different function for every button
